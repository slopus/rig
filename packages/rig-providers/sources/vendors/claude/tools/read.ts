Paths outside the active workspace may require permission or be blocked by the selected permission mode.\nIf the user provides a path to a file, assume the path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool reads common image formats (for example PNG and JPG) and presents them visually.\n- Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) are not supported. Ask the user to export the notebook to a plain-text format before reading it.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the Bash tool.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- Empty files are returned as `(empty file)`.",
