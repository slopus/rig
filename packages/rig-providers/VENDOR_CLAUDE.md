# Claude provider

This package runs Claude through `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, while Rig remains the
owner of conversation persistence, tool execution, permissions, and the agent loop. The
provider intentionally uses Claude Code's inference, streaming, retry, replay, and native
compaction machinery without adopting Claude Code's native tools or security model.

## Reference behavior

The implementation is checked against:

- the installed Claude Agent SDK and its public `Options`, `SessionStore`, and SDK message
  types;
- the vanilla Claude Code source at `~/Developer/coding-assistant-sources/claude-code`;
- the native CLI trace in
  `tests/vendors/fixtures/claude-multiturn.json`;
- the real Rig-provider trace in
  `tests/vendors/fixtures/claude-provider-multiturn.json`.

Relevant vanilla sources include `src/QueryEngine.ts` for SDK messages and persistence,
`src/utils/conversationRecovery.ts` for transcript recovery, `src/services/api/withRetry.ts`
for retry behavior, and `src/services/compact/compact.ts` for native summaries and
`compact_boundary`.

## Runtime construction

`ClaudeProvider.ts` constructs `ClaudeSession.ts`. Each Rig session receives a private UUID
for the SDK's resume contract; the caller's Rig session ID remains independent. Every run
reconstructs the SDK transcript from the caller-supplied `SessionContext` through
`impl/createClaudeSessionReplay.ts` when a query is first created. Compatible subsequent
turns use the same streaming SDK query and subprocess, so the HTTP connection and prompt
cache remain live. Claude's filesystem transcript is not Rig's source of truth.

`impl/toClaudeSdkOptions.ts` deliberately strips the native Claude environment:

- `tools: []` disables native tools.
- `settingSources: []`, `skills: []`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_MDS`, and the related
  environment flags disable native settings, CLAUDE.md loading, bundled skills,
  attachments, and built-in agents.
- `extraArgs["disable-slash-commands"]` disables ordinary slash commands. It is omitted
  only for a native `/compact` request.
- `permissionMode: "dontAsk"` prevents Claude Code from owning permission interaction.
- Native compaction alone uses `maxTurns: 1` and a closed prompt stream because `/compact`
  is a terminal SDK command; ordinary turns use the persistent prompt queue.

These settings are invariants. Enabling native tools or native permissions would bypass
Rig's shared `AgentContext` and permission boundary.

## System prompt and skills

The complete model-specific runtime prompts live in `rig-execution`. The provider receives
the already assembled instructions through `SessionContext`; prompt files in this package
are test assets, not runtime prompt sources.

`impl/toClaudeSdkOptions.ts` assembles the supplied prompt in this order:

1. session instructions assembled by the executor;
2. system messages from the session context;
3. Rig skill metadata.

The SDK adds its own small SDK identity and billing blocks on the final Anthropic request.
The Rig prompt remains a distinct complete system block; the provider golden fixture
captures the resulting full wire request.

Rig supplies skill name, description, source, and location as prompt metadata. It does not
enable Claude Code's expanded native skill runtime. Loading skill contents remains a Rig
agent-loop concern.

## MCP tools and schemas

The provider has no default tool catalog. The Rig agent owns Claude definitions one tool
per file under `packages/rig/sources/agent/tools/claude/`, converts them to `SessionTool`,
and supplies the exact set for each run. The same caller-owned set remains stable across
compatible model switches.

Independent model-specific golden definitions remain one tool per file under
`sources/vendors/claude/tools/`. They are test and trace-capture assets, not runtime
fallbacks. The parity tests compare their complete tool names and model-facing argument
shapes with the executable Rig tools, and compare changed contracts exactly.

`impl/toClaudeSdkOptions.ts` creates an in-process MCP server named `rig`. Its `tools/list`
handler returns each `SessionTool` description and TypeBox schema directly as MCP
`inputSchema`; there is no TypeBox-to-Zod rewrite. This preserves constraints such as
integer bounds, unions, descriptions, required fields, and `additionalProperties`.

The SDK receives:

- `allowedTools` containing `mcp__rig__<name>`;
- `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_MCP_NO_PREFIX=1`, so the model sees Rig-compatible unprefixed names;
- `tools: []`, so no native tool definitions are mixed into the request.

The MCP call handler waits on `ClaudeToolBridge`. Rig returns the emitted call to its own
agent loop, executes it through the shared permission boundary, and supplies the committed
result to that pending MCP call on the next run. The bridge keeps resolver and early-answer
maps keyed by tool-call ID, so either side may arrive first and every parallel call settles
exactly once. The SDK query stays alive throughout.

## Streaming and external tools

`ClaudeSession.ts` maps Claude streaming blocks into Rig events:

- text and thinking deltas become `text_delta` and `reasoning_delta`;
- signatures become `encrypted_reasoning`;
- tool-use starts, JSON deltas, and block stops become
  `tool_call_start`/`tool_call_delta`/`tool_call_end`;
- usage becomes `token_usage`;
- the terminal state is `tool_call`, `normal`, or `error`.

Rig persists the assistant tool call, executes it, and invokes the session again with the
corresponding tool-result message. On a live query, `ClaudeToolBridge` resolves Claude's
pending MCP request with text and image content and the same SDK process continues.
Reconstructed sessions retain `sourceToolAssistantUUID`, which lets vanilla Claude
associate results with their tool-use assistant.
Rig also preserves the tool result's `isError` bit through both the live MCP response and
the reconstructed Claude `tool_result.is_error` block.

Vanilla `conversationRecovery.ts` behavior is used only when a session must be reconstructed,
such as after a model or compaction configuration change. Normal tool continuation does not
interrupt or replay the query.

Multiple parallel tool results are grouped into one Claude user replay entry containing every
`tool_result` block and linked to the originating assistant. The next explicit Rig prompt
starts the next user turn.

## Multi-turn replay, images, and model switching

For a first one-message turn, the SDK receives a fresh `sessionId`. For reconstructed
history, `impl/createClaudeSessionReplay.ts` supplies an in-memory `SessionStore` and
`resume` ID. Stable UUIDs preserve parent ordering across a replay without writing a
Claude transcript to disk.

User messages and tool results may contain ordered text and base64 image blocks. Replay
maps them to Claude-native `text` and `image` content blocks. Assistant history remains
text plus tool-use blocks because Rig currently has no assistant-image output modality.

A run-level model overrides the active model and is retained for later turns and
compaction. Replay serializes historical assistant entries with the currently selected
model because the SDK entry type requires a model; the actual next request uses the
selected model. The real provider trace switches from Opus to Sonnet and verifies the
selected prompt and stable caller-owned tools on the wire.

## Retries

Vanilla Claude Code retries retryable transport and API failures before producing a final
result. Its default is ten retries and it emits SDK `system/api_retry` messages containing
the attempt, maximum, delay, category, and HTTP status.

Rig forces `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_RETRIES=10` in `impl/toClaudeSdkOptions.ts`, overriding inherited
values so provider behavior is stable. `impl/toClaudeRetryEvent.ts` converts each native
retry notification into a Rig `retrying` event. Rig does not replay the query itself; the
retry remains inside Claude Code, avoiding duplicate tool or session effects.

## Native compaction

`ClaudeSession.compact()` appends either `/compact` or `/compact <retention instructions>`
to the reconstructed context and temporarily enables slash-command handling. This invokes
Claude Code's native compactor, not a Rig-authored summarization request.

The SDK persists the native `isCompactSummary` entry into the in-memory `SessionStore` and
emits `compact_boundary`. The provider requires both successful boundary completion and a
non-empty persisted summary. It then returns replacement Rig context containing the
initial messages plus Claude's native summary. A failed native status, missing summary,
tool call, or cancellation leaves the original context active.

The provider fixture covers custom retention instructions and post-compaction continuation.
`tests/claude.live.test.ts` separately covers real native compaction without custom
instructions.

## Credentials and lifecycle

Before spawning Claude, `impl/toClaudeSdkOptions.ts` removes
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from the inherited
environment and sets exactly the selected credential. This prevents a stale host
credential from taking precedence.

The provider also removes `CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_FILE_DESCRIPTOR` and the inherited Bedrock,
Foundry, and Vertex backend selectors. This prevents host configuration from silently
changing the selected Claude transport.

`claudeSdkPrivacyEnvironment.ts` carries the original Rig privacy environment and the
package-level compaction constraint. It disables Anthropic and standard OpenTelemetry
exporters, prompt/tool-content logging, enhanced telemetry, Perfetto tracing, error and
feedback reporting, surveys, updater and plugin-updater traffic, and nonessential Claude
traffic. The complete environment is applied both to the SDK subprocess and to
`settings.env`; inherited values cannot re-enable these paths.

`DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT=1` prevents Claude Code from compacting autonomously. Rig deliberately
does not set `DISABLE_COMPACT`, so an outer-loop request can still invoke native manual
`/compact`.

Rig abort signals immediately stop the active turn, close the prompt queue, MCP bridge, SDK
query, and subprocess, and rotate the private SDK session ID. The next prompt therefore starts
a fresh Claude SDK session instead of resuming a query that may still be waiting for tool
results. The listener is removed on normal completion, error, synchronous query-construction
failure, or cancellation. The same resources are also closed by `destroy()`, or when model,
effort, tools, prompt, or compaction mode changes.

## Trace and test coverage

`tests/vendors/captureClaudeTrace.mjs` captures vanilla CLI behavior with real inference,
native tools and skills, model switching, and native `/compact`. It is a reference for
Claude Code behavior, not a Rig-provider replay.

`tests/vendors/captureClaudeProviderTrace.ts` runs the real `ClaudeSession` through a local
forwarding proxy and records actual Anthropic requests and SSE responses. Its scenario
covers a Rig MCP tool call, external tool result, another turn, model switch, native
compaction with retention instructions, and post-compaction continuation.

`tests/vendors/claudeGolden.test.ts` replays the provider fixture through the real SDK and
compares every normalized request body exactly. Dynamic IDs, paths, timestamps, signatures,
and the SDK current-date reminder are normalized. `tests/claudeSession.test.ts` covers
message mapping, retry events, credential isolation, abort cleanup, images, models, and
plain/custom compaction. `tests/claude.live.test.ts` verifies real inference, complete
system prompts and schemas, model switching, both compaction forms, and continuation.

## Intentional limitations

- Rig owns persistence; native Claude transcript files are not authoritative.
- Rig owns all tool execution and permissions; the SDK MCP handler only waits for the
  result committed by Rig.
- Claude Code settings, CLAUDE.md, attachments, native agents, and native skills remain
  disabled.
- Each Rig run returns one terminal outer-loop state. A compatible sequence of runs shares
  one live Claude SDK query and subprocess.
- The provider does not reproduce every Claude Code UI, hook, plugin, IDE, or local-command
  feature.
- Provider model catalogs are curated elsewhere in Rig; the SDK is not used for model
  discovery.
