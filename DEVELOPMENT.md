# Developing Rig

Thanks for helping improve Rig. This guide contains the repository-specific
setup, testing, and release details that contributors need. For product usage
and configuration, start with the [README](README.md).

## Repository layout

Rig is a pnpm TypeScript workspace.

- `packages/rig` contains the published `@slopus/rig` CLI, agent runtime, and
  local daemon. Its entry point is `packages/rig/sources/main.ts`.
- `packages/rig-dev` contains the private live-source `rig-dev` launcher.
- `packages/gym` contains the host-side end-to-end harness, PTY integration,
  fixtures, and Docker image definition.
- `packages/gym-tests` contains black-box terminal scenarios that exercise the
  built Rig agent in fresh containers.
- `scripts` contains repository release automation.

Shared TypeScript and code-quality configuration lives at the workspace root.
Root commands run the relevant package scripts.

## Setup

Install dependencies from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Start the development CLI in its own terminal:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

To make the development CLI available as `rig-dev` from any directory, link its
private package once:

```sh
pnpm link:dev
```

Use `pnpm unlink:dev` to remove the global link. The released `rig` command is
unaffected because the two commands come from separate packages.

Both development commands run live source from this checkout. They keep their
daemon socket, token, logs, registry, and session database in the checkout's
ignored `.rig-dev` directory while using the directory where `rig-dev` was
invoked as the session workspace. They do not reuse or replace the installed
Rig daemon. When runtime source changes, the CLI fingerprints it and asks before
restarting an older workspace daemon.

## Live process debugging

Run `/debug` in any interactive Rig session to start loopback-only Node
inspectors for both the terminal UI and daemon. The command reports the current
session, state directory, and both inspector URLs. In either inspector, evaluate
`globalThis.__rigDebug` to start walking the live process state.

Breakpoints suspend the process they target until it is resumed. Native
inspector output from the daemon is written to the state directory's
`server.log`. The TUI inherits Rig's stderr, so redirect it when starting Rig if
you want to keep inspector messages out of the interface, for example
`rig 2>rig-tui.log`. If stderr is still the terminal, `/debug` warns and asks for
confirmation before starting. The inspectors use ephemeral ports bound to
`127.0.0.1`; Node does not authenticate inspector connections, so do not expose
those ports beyond the local machine.

## Validation

Run these checks separately from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm run check
pnpm test
pnpm run build
pnpm run format:check
pnpm run lint
```

Use a check that is proportionate to the change, and run all relevant checks
before publishing.

## End-to-end gym

The gym runs the built Rig CLI and daemon through a real PTY in a fresh Docker
container. Only inference is mocked; shell processes, tools, files, daemon
behavior, terminal rendering, interruption, and concurrency are real.

Read [packages/gym-tests/README.md](packages/gym-tests/README.md) before creating
or debugging a gym test. It is the source of truth for prerequisites,
`createGym`, fixtures, terminal snapshots, scroll tracking, targeted commands,
and cleanup.

Run the complete suite with:

```sh
pnpm test:gym
```

For a behavior regression, first reproduce the failure in
`packages/gym-tests/tests`, then make the same scenario pass without weakening
it. Name scenarios for the behavior they prove, interact at the terminal
boundary, wait for observable state instead of sleeping, and dispose every gym
instance.

## Agent evaluations

Read [EVALUATIONS.md](EVALUATIONS.md) before comparing Rig with another agent
harness. It defines the frozen hard-task suite, paired run contract, spend
gates, Docker and credential isolation, preflight requirements, and reporting
rules. A benchmark run is not authorized merely because its configuration is
documented; paid trials remain blocked until that guide's preflight is complete.

## Provider reference sources

Local reference implementations live in `~/Developer/coding-assistant-sources`,
including the Codex and Claude Code source trees. Consult them when implementing
or comparing provider-aligned behavior. Preserve the useful model-facing
semantics while adapting them to Rig's simpler product model.

Pi packages are used as foundations for model streaming and the terminal UI.
Rig intentionally layers a curated experience on top instead of mirroring every
Pi customization mechanism.

## Code organization

Favor one function per file when adding or reshaping source code. Keep all
user-facing strings human-readable, and translate protocol values or internal
identifiers into natural English before rendering them.

For terminal work, treat the visible transcript as append-only. Update an
existing activity row in place when its state changes, and move completed live
work into history without making the composer jump.

## Publishing

From a clean, current `main` branch, publish with:

```sh
pnpm release 0.1.0
```

The release command also accepts `patch`, `minor`, or `major`. It runs type
checks and tests, builds the package, creates the release commit and tag,
previews the package contents, and pushes the release to `main`. Pushing a tag
named `v<package version>` starts the `Publish package` GitHub Actions workflow,
which repeats the validation and publishes `@slopus/rig` to npm.

If the local release is interrupted before the tag is pushed, rerun the command
with the exact version to resume safely. If the GitHub Actions job fails, fix the
configuration or transient failure and rerun that job instead of creating a new
tag.

### One-time publishing setup

The publish workflow uses npm Trusted Publishing, so it does not need a
long-lived npm token or a contributor's npm account:

1. In the GitHub repository settings, create an environment named `npm`. Under
   deployment branches and tags, select only matching tags and add `v*`. Do not
   add required reviewers if every collaborator with permission to create tags
   should be able to release.
2. In the npm settings for `@slopus/rig`, add a GitHub Actions trusted publisher
   for organization `slopus`, repository `rig`, workflow `publish.yml`, and
   environment `npm`. Allow the `npm publish` action.
3. Do not create an `NPM_TOKEN` GitHub secret. The workflow requests a short-lived
   OIDC credential for each run and npm automatically records provenance for the
   public package.

Anyone with GitHub write access can then run `pnpm release <version>` from an
up-to-date `main` branch without receiving npm access. Keep tag creation limited
to trusted collaborators; creating a matching tag is authorization to publish.
